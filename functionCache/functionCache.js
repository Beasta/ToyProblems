/*
If you are calculating complex things or execute time-consuming API calls, you sometimes want to cache the results. In this case we want you to create a function wrapper, which takes a function and caches its results depending on the arguments, that were applied to the function.

Usage example:

var complexFunction = function(arg1, arg2) { /* complex calculation in here */ /*};
var cachedFunction = cache(complexFunction);

cachedFunction('foo', 'bar'); // complex function should be executed
cachedFunction('foo', 'bar'); // complex function should not be invoked again, instead the cached result should be returned
cachedFunction('foo', 'baz'); // should be executed, because the method wasn't invoked before with these arguments
*/

// Create your own tests here. These are some of the methods available:
//  Test.expect(boolean, [optional] message) 
//  Test.assertEquals(actual, expected, [optional] message)
//  Test.assertSimilar(actual, expected, [optional] message)
//  Test.assertNotEquals(actual, expected, [optional] message) 

function cache(func) {
  // do your magic here
}
